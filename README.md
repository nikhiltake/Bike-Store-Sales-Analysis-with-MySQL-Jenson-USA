🚴‍♂️ Project Title: Bike Store Sales Analysis with MySQL | Product, Customer & Revenue Insights

Excited to share my latest data-driven project where I explored a fictional Bike Store database using MySQL to uncover valuable business insights! From identifying top-performing stores to analyzing customer behavior and revenue trends — this was a deep dive into real-world sales analysis. 🔍📦

📊 Key Project Highlights:

✔ Schema & Data Understanding

🔹 Analyzed SQL scripts for object creation and data loading

🔹 Understood relationships across tables like stores, orders, products, customers, and categories

✔ Sales Performance & Revenue

🔹 Calculated total products sold by each store

🔹 Identified the highest revenue-generating product (quantity × price) for every category

🔹 Tracked the cumulative quantity of products sold over time for demand analysis

✔ Customer & Order Insights

🔹 Found the customer who spent the most on orders

🔹 Analyzed customer patterns across products and dates

🔹 Explored how different customers interact with stores and products

✔ Advanced SQL Skills in Action

🔹 Implemented window functions like RANK() and CUMULATIVE SUM

🔹 Used JOINs, CTEs, and GROUP BY to structure and filter data

🔹 Focused on writing optimized and scalable queries for real-world datasets

💡 What I Gained:

This project sharpened my ability to think analytically, write efficient SQL, and extract meaningful stories from raw sales data. It also helped me understand how businesses use structured data to drive decisions.

📌 Next Step:

I’m now working on visualizing these insights using Power BI, creating dashboards that show revenue breakdowns, store performance, and customer insights.
